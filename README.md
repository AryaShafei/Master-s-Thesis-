Thesis-focused project. 

From 2022 to 2024, I was a graduate student at Carleton University and also served as a research assistant for Ottawa’s Coordinated Access
and Referral to Services, where I led a community-based research project examining school absenteeism among youth in Ottawa. This work involved analyzing multiple risk
domains, including externalizing and internalizing behaviours, family dynamics, adverse childhood experiences, and psychological disorders. The project required extensive data coding,
data management, quantitative analysis, and visualization using a mixture of R, SQL, and MS Excel softwares.
